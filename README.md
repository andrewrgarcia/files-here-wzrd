# files-here-wzrd

An intuitive toolset for capturing and recreating directory structures effortlessly! files-here-wzrd allows you to generate a complete snapshot of your project files in a single .txt file, ideal for sharing, backup, or AI-driven analysis. Easily rebuild entire directories from a text-based blueprint, and complement this process with powerful AI tools like GPT for project generation and insights.

## Overview

The `files-here-wzrd` toolkit includes two key algorithms:

- [**`ShowFilesHere`**](show): Captures and outputs all files with specified extensions in a directory into a single, organized `.txt` file.
- [**`MakeFilesHere`**](make): Reconstructs files and their directory structure from a `.txt` file created by `ShowFilesHere.sh`.

This toolkit is ideal for developers, researchers, and teams working with large codebases or datasets who need a quick way to navigate and document their projects or to reconstruct files for easier distribution or analysis with AI tools.
